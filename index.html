      <hr>


      <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At freeCodeCamp we have a
      few fundamental principles:</p>


      <ol>
        <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
        (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or
        income level for no apparent reason.)</li>


        <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to
        comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>


        <li>Unless you ask us not to (by clicking the button that says "hide
        all my solutions from other people" located on your code portfolio), we
        will share your solutions and progress with the public as part of our
        open data initiative. This is intended for academics and researchers to
        better understand freeCodeCamp as an educational model.</li>


        <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required
        for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>


        <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s
        visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and
        permanently deleted. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates
        these goals</li>
      </ol>


      <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data
      please email us at <a href="mailto:team@freecodecamp.org">team@freecodecamp.org</a>.</p>


      <p>freeCodeCamp Inc. (“<strong>freeCodeCamp</strong>”) operates several
      websites including <a href=
      "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. It is freeCodeCamp’s
      policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
      while operating our websites.</p>


      <h3><a id="Website_Visitors_19"></a>Website Visitors</h3>


      <p>Like most website operators, freeCodeCamp collects
      non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
      servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
      preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
      request. freeCodeCamp’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
      information is to better understand how freeCodeCamp’s visitors use its
      website. From time to time, freeCodeCamp may release
      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
      publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>


      <p>freeCodeCamp also collects potentially personally-identifying
      information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and
      for users leaving comments on <a href=
      "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> blogs. freeCodeCamp only
      discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
      circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses
      and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of
      the blog where the comment was left.</p>


      <h3><a id=
      "Gathering_of_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_25"></a>Gathering of
      Personally-Identifying Information</h3>


      <p>Many visitors to freeCodeCamp’s websites choose to interact with
      freeCodeCamp in ways that require freeCodeCamp to gather
      personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
      that freeCodeCamp gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
      example, we ask visitors who create an account for tracking their
      progress at <a href="https://www.freeCodeCamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a> to
      provide either an email address or sign in with a social media oauth
      service like GitHub. Those who engage in transactions with freeCodeCamp –
      by placing job ads, for example – are asked to provide additional
      information, including as necessary the personal and financial
      information required to process those transactions. In each case,
      freeCodeCamp collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
      appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with
      freeCodeCamp. freeCodeCamp does not disclose personally-identifying
      information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse
      to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
      prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>


      <h3><a id="Aggregated_Statistics_29"></a>Aggregated Statistics</h3>


      <p>freeCodeCamp may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to
      its websites. For instance, freeCodeCamp may monitor the accounts to try
      and identify spammers. freeCodeCamp may display this information publicly
      or provide it to others. However, freeCodeCamp does not disclose
      personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>


      <h3><a id=
      "Protection_of_Certain_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_33"></a>Protection
      of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>


      <p>freeCodeCamp discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
      contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
      information in order to process it on freeCodeCamp’s behalf or to provide
      services available at freeCodeCamp’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed
      not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
      affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
      using freeCodeCamp’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such
      information to them. freeCodeCamp will not rent or sell potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
      Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
      described above, freeCodeCamp discloses potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in
      response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
      when freeCodeCamp believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
      necessary to protect the property or rights of freeCodeCamp, third
      parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an
      freeCodeCamp website and have supplied your email address, freeCodeCamp
      may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
      solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on
      with freeCodeCamp and our products. We primarily use our various product
      blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this
      type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
      support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
      right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your
      request or to help us support other users. freeCodeCamp takes all
      measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access,
      use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information.</p>


      <h3><a id="Cookies_37"></a>Cookies</h3>


      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
      visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the
      website each time the visitor returns. freeCodeCamp uses cookies to help
      freeCodeCamp identify and track visitors, their usage of freeCodeCamp
      website, and their website access preferences. freeCodeCamp visitors who
      do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
      browsers to refuse cookies before using freeCodeCamp’s websites, with the
      drawback that certain features of freeCodeCamp’s websites may not
      function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>


      <h3><a id="Business_Transfers_41"></a>Business Transfers</h3>


      <p>If freeCodeCamp, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or
      in the unlikely event that freeCodeCamp goes out of business or enters
      bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
      transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
      transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of freeCodeCamp may continue
      to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>


      <h3><a id="Ads_45"></a>Ads</h3>


      <p>If in the future we show ads, ads appearing on any of our websites may
      be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
      cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they
      send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or
      others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to,
      among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe
      will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
      cookies by freeCodeCamp and does not cover the use of cookies by any
      advertisers.</p>


      <h3><a id="Privacy_Policy_Changes_53"></a>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>


      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, freeCodeCamp may change
      its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in freeCodeCamp’s sole
      discretion. freeCodeCamp encourages visitors to frequently check this
      page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a <a href=
      "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> account, you should also
      check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued
      use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute
      your acceptance of such change.</p>
